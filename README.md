#### A Word-Chompin' Program | Released 11-11-2017

#### By Ben Parisot

## Description

This page was created to satisfy the Arrays and Looping Independent Project in Epicodus' Intro to Programming Evening Course. The page uses Javascript and JQuery to take in a number from a user and count up to that number from 1, with numbers divisible by 3, 5, and 15 being replaced by the words "nom", "nosh", and "chomp chomp chomp", respectively.

The program specs are as follows:
1. The program must accept a number and count from 1 to that number
	⁃	Example input: 3
	⁃	Example output: [1, 2, 3]
2. The program must determine if a number is divisible by 3 and, if so, replace that number with "nom"
	⁃	Example input: 3
	⁃	Example output: [1, 2, “nom”]
3. The program must determine if a number is divisible by 5 and, if so, replace that number with "nosh"
	⁃	Example input: 5
	⁃	Example output: [1, 2, 3, 4, “nosh”]
4. The program must determine if a number is divisible by 15 and, if so, replace that number with "chomp chomp chomp"
	⁃	Example input: 15
	⁃	Example output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, “chomp chomp chomp”]
5. The program must display each result from counting on the page in an unordered list
6. The program must, pop up an alert reading “Try again with an actual number, jerk." if the user enters something other than a number
7. The program must clear the input field after every button submit
8. The program must remove results and replace with new results after every button submit
